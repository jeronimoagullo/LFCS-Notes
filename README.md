This repository contains all my notes for [Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/). The repository is structured into theory (`Notes` folder) and practical exercises (`Exercises`folder) similar to the LFCS ones that I developed myself during training.

The notes and exercises are structured in the following way:
1. Essential commands
2. Users and Groups
3. Operations and deployments
4. Storage
5. Networking

There is an extra file titled `Linux_command_list.md` which contains a list of most important commands with tips and most typical use cases structured into the above sections. This file is intended to be used as reference source after or during reading the theory.
